`WebPKit` is an open source framework that wraps Google's [WebP library](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) to provide native-feeling Cocoa APIs for working with WebP image files on all of Apple's platforms.

`WebPKit` allows for easily encoding and decoding WebP files to `UIImage` or `NSImage` objects. It also includes advanced features such as decoding WebP images to custom sizes.

# Features
* Read image files in the WebP format.
* Write in-memory images to the WebP format.
* Supports *all* of Apple's platforms (including Mac Catalyst).
* Additional convenience methods for quickly verifying WebP data before decoding.
* 100% Swift, and fully unit-tested.

# Requirements

* **iOS:** 9.0 and above
* **macOS:** 10.9 and above
* **tvOS:** 9.0 and above
* **watchOS:** 2.0 and above

When installing manually, you will also need Google's `WebP` C library as well. Precompiled static binaries are available at [the Cocoa-WebP repo](https://github.com/TimOliver/WebP-Cocoa).

# Usage

`WebPKit` provides extensions to a variety of popular Cocoa classes in order to natively provide WebP format support.

### Verifying a WebP image file

`WebPKit` provides a variety of methods to check the contents of a file or some data to see if it is a valid WebP file.

```swift
import WebPKit 

// Check a `Data` object to see if it contains WebP data
let webpData = Data(...) 
print(webpData.isWebP)

// Check a file on disk to see if it is a WebP file
let url = URL(...) 
print(url.isWebP)

// Retrieve the pixel size of the image without decoding it
let size = CGImage.sizeOfWebP(with: Data())
```

### Decoding a WebP image

`WebPKit` performs decoding of WebP image data at the `CGImage` level, and then provides convenience initialisers for `UIImage` and `NSImage` on iOS-based platforms and macOS respectively.

#### iOS / iPadOS / tvOS / watchOS

```swift
import WebPKit 

// Load from data in memory
let webpImage = UIImage(webpData: Data()

// Load from disk
let webpImage = UIImage(contentsOfWebPFile: URL())
 
// Load from resource bundle
let webpImage = UIImage.webpNamed("MyWebPImage")
```

#### macOS

```swift
import WebPKit 

// Load from data in memory
let webpImage = NSImage(webpData: Data()

// Load from disk
let webpImage = NSImage(contentsOfWebPFile: URL())
 
// Load from resource bundle
let webpImage = NSImage.webpNamed("MyWebPImage")
```

# Why Build This?

Support for WebP image files had been a growing feature request in my comic reader app [iComics](http://icomics/co) for a number of years. With iComics being in Objective-C, I was able to use [one of the many libraries](https://github.com/mattt/WebPImageSerialization) on GitHub out there to easily support it.

But while that was the case for Objective-C, while I've been working on iComics 2, I started to realise that there still wasn't a great amount of WebP support for Apple's more modern platforms and features. 

Google's own precompiled binaries don't support either Swift or Mac Catalyst, and all the Swift libraries I found didn't provide features I needed, like CocoaPods support, or decoding at different sizes.

For a feature that will be an extremely fundamental pillar in iComics 2, I decided that it would be worth the time and investment to make a *really* good WebP framework for the Apple ecosystem.

A huge shout-out also goes to the `SDWebImage` team for [maintaining CocoaPods and Carthage releases](https://github.com/SDWebImage/libwebp-Xcode) for WebP all this time as well.
